"""Auto-skip tests whose external service is unreachable.

A suite that needs a live service must not FAIL on a machine where that service
is simply not running: it must SKIP. Failing conflates "the code is wrong" with
"the database is down", and it blocks every push from a developer machine that
does not host the whole fleet.

The gate is marker-driven and data-owned: ``CONNECTIVITY_MARKER_CONTAINERS`` maps
a pytest marker to the shared container whose declared host/port is probed. Each
endpoint is probed at most once per session, and only when a collected test
actually carries the marker, so suites that need nothing external pay nothing.

A reachable service is never skipped — a service that answers and then
misbehaves still fails, which is the whole point of the suite.
